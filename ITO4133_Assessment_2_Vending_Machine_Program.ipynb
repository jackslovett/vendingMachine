        "This Vending Machine Program is a Python-based application designed to simulate the functionality of a vending machine. This program allows users to select products, make payments, and receive their desired items.\n",
        "\n",
        "**High-Level Design Overview**\n",
        "\n",
        "The program utilizes a dictionary, products, to store information about the available products, including their prices and stock availability. The user interface is presented in the command line interface (CLI).\n",
        "\n",
        "The program flow can be summarized as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "Upon execution, the program displays a welcome message and the list of available products with their corresponding prices.\n",
        "The user can select products by entering the name of the item. Additional options are available for customizations such as sugar or milk.\n",
        "\n",
        "The program checks the availability of the selected product and processes the choice accordingly. If the product is in stock and the user has enough credit, the item is dispensed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Payment processing is handled by accepting coins in dollars. The program ensures that the inserted coins are valid and accumulates the payment until it covers the total price.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the user cancels the purchase or provides insufficient credit, the program allows them to edit the selection or cancels the transaction, returning the payment.\n",
        "Upon successful payment, the program displays a receipt with the selected products and the total price. The transaction details are recorded in a transaction history.\n",
        "\n",
        "The program provides an additional administrative mode accessible through a password. In admin mode, restocking items, placing or lifting maintenance mode, and viewing transaction history are possible.\n",
        "The vending machine program offers a user-friendly experience, allowing customers to interact with the virtual vending machine and make their desired purchases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below are screenshots of the program being executed, illustrating its various functionalities and how they address the requirements of Assessment 2.\n",
